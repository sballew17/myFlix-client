# myFlix-client
<p> My objective for this application was to build a client side website using React to display data produced from backend development from my MovieAPI.</p>

## About 
<p> My application is specifically for looking at Superhero movies. The user can view each movie and it will display the Title, Desciption, Directors and Genre of the movies. Users will also have the ability to register and be able to add movies to a favorites list. </p>

## Project Dependencies
<p> Axios, Bootstrap, Parcel, Prop-types, React, React-Bootstrap, React-DOM, and Redux. </p>
